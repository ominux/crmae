Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM) is a promising candidate for future  
on-chip cache design due to its high-density, low leakage, and immunity to 
soft errors.  However, it's high write latency and dynamic
write energy are the disadvantages compared to SRAM-based cache design.
In this paper, we propose to trade off the non-volatility (data retention time)
for better write performance/energy in STT-RAM cache design. We study two
data-retention relaxation cases, one with data retention time of 1 second, which satisfies the lifetime requirement of typical cache blocks; and the other one with data retention time of 1ms, which is a more aggressive design for better performance/energy gains but a data refreshing mechanism is needed. Our 
experimental results show that.....
