These MTJ designs (10-32$F^2$) are not realistic and give an inaccurate picture of the current technology. We feel that there is not much scope to
further reduce the baseline area of the state-of-the-art MTJ designs of 2-3$F^2$~\cite{STTRAM:Grandis11} and hence, we focus on other optimization parameters to get optimal operating points. 



This exhaustive application-level analysis 
with multi-threaded and multi-programmed applications, shows that a very aggressive {\it $\mu$s} 
level retention time advocated in~\cite{STTRAM:HPCA11} is unsuitable for the LLC and
we propose to be in the range of $10ms$.
