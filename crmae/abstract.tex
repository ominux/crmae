Emerging memory technologies such as STT-RAM, PCRAM and resistive RAM are being
explored as potential
replacements to existing on-chip caches or main memories for future multi-core
architectures. This is
due to the many attractive features these memory technologies posses: high
density, low leakage, and
non-volatility. However, the latency and energy overhead associated with the
write operations of
these emerging memories has become a major obstacle in their adoption. Previous
works have proposed
various circuit and architectural level solutions
